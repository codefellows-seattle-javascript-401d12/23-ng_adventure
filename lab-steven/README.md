#Angular Adventure Game

###Overview
This is a text-based adventure game, similar to MUDs or MUSHes, that was built within Angular's framework. It was a project made for Code Fellows Javascript 401 Day 4 of Angular assignment over the course of a couple days.

The aesthetic of the site is designed to mock up the functionality of a telnet client, while the actual workings of the app were to practice the use of services, components, and breaking apart SCSS files into modular folders. This was the first project I made using Angular's service and component framework.

###Installation
To install this app, clone down this repository, then navigate to the `lab-steven` directory and run `npm i`.

###Usage
In order to use the app, after you've done `npm i`, run `npm run watch` to create a dev server using Webpack on your localhost port. Then open up your browser and navigate to `localhost:<port>`, where port is whatever port Webpack's dev server is running on.
